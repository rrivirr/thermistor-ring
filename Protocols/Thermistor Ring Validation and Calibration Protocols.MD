# Flow sensor thermistor ring tests

## Part 1
###  **Part 1a: Ambient temperature tests**
* Start sensors logging at 1 minute or 5 minute intervals in a space with consistent temperature.
    * Make sure when you deploy that the experiment name includes the thermistor ring ID.
* At least every day take a temperature measurement and record in lab notebook.

### **Part 1b: Evaluating temperature performance**
* Do sensors drift over time?
* Are there any blips in the data or is it consistent?
* How closely matched are the different thermistors to each other?
* How closely matched are the different thermistors to our manual temperature measurements?
